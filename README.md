# Technical Documentation - EMA SmPC Scraping

## üì∞ **Context and Objective**

This Python project automatically downloads the PDF files of SmPCs (Summary of Product Characteristics) for human medicines authorized and withdrawn from the European market from the EMA website. 
The goal is to build a reliable and usable database to speed up access to this information.

## üìö **Project Organization**

The code is organized into several folders:

- **`adapters`**: contains "adapters" to the outside world (e.g., website connection, downloads)
    - `download_file.py`
- **`core`**: contains the pure business logic (independent from the outside world)
    - `update_rcp.py`
    - `manipulate_df.py`
- **`main.py`**: entry point of the program that orchestrates everything
